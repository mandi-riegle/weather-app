# weather-app

I am currently developing a working weather application that displays the current weather along with the 5-day forecast. 
The main purpose is to showcase my Frontend Developer skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am using Visual Studio, Bootstrap, multiple API's, and 
GitHub to develop this project, as well as Netlify as a web hosting service. I should have this project completed by April 2022. The next step will
be to recreate this project in React.js.
